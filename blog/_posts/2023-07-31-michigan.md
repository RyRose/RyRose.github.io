After spending the night in Dearborn and dealing with annoying rental car issues again, I made my way to my main stop for the day, the [Henry Ford Museum](https://www.thehenryford.org). I assumed it'd be similar to the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green but I was pleasantly surprised that it covered much more than just Henry Ford. For instance, the car JFK was assassinated in.

Overall, there was a lot to see and I enjoyed the museum. Afterwards, I continued my drive to the next state. Onwards to Indiana!
