My main stop in South Carolina was [Congaree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/cong).

*Congaree National Park*

They had a great elevated boardwalk loop where you wandered around the forest, which almost felt tropical with how high its canopy was. The bugs were terrible but the forest was absolutely gorgeous. Afterwards, I checked into my hotel in Columbia and grabbed some fast food. The next day, I started driving towards my next state. Onwards to North Carolina!
