My first stop in Georgia was at [The Varsity](https://thevarsity.com) in Atlanta for lunch.

From what I've read, people typically go to this landmark for the *experience* and not the food, which I disagree with. Neither is really worth going for. Still, the food was okay and it was a pretty standard diner experience. After getting my fill, I continued to Athens, where I stayed for the night. I walked around downtown Athens, ate dinner at an Irish pub, and stopped to see this tree.

The next morning, I ate breakfast and started again towards my next state. Onwards to South Carolina!
