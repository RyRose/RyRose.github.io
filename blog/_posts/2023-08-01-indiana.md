My main stop in Indiana was [Indiana Dunes National Park](https://www.nps.gov/indu).

After spending the night in South Bend and eating at a delicious [Mexican restaurant](https://plazaaztecamexicanrestaurant.com) nearby my hotel, I started driving to the park the next morning. I spent a few hours at the park hiking nearby the beaches and wetlands. I was surprised to see both so nearby each other given how disparate the experiences were.

After finishing my hikes, I continued the drive towards my next state. Onwards to Wisconsin!
