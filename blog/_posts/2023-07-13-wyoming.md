Following Idaho, I spent the night in [West Yellowstone, MT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yellowstone,_Montana). It's basically a massive tourist trap of a town but I got some decent food at a [Mexican food truck](https://goo.gl/maps/NHA9YTHktEs7DA2o8) and watched the new spiderverse movie at a local IMAX theatre. The next day, I drove through Yellowstone and stopped at a few places.

I think my favorite spot at Yellowstone was here at [Biscuit Basin](https://www.nps.gov/places/000/biscuit-basin-trailhead-ok4.htm) and I did go see Old Faithful. These pools were gorgeous and there was a nice ~2 mile loop that included the overlook below.

After Yellowstone, I continued driving down to [Jackson, WY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Wyoming) where I stayed the night. I didn't too much that night except grab pizza from a [local place](https://handfirepizza.com) and sleep. I was bit tired from the day's hike. The following day, I drove to Grand Teton National Park and took the ferry ride across [Jenny Lake](https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/jennylakeplan.htm).

It was a relatively short hike from there to the overlook below.

At this point, I was still rearing to hike and decided to try out [cascade canyon](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/cascadecanyon.htm).

I ended up hiking for about four hours in total and got a nasty sunburn but it was a very pretty forested hike between the mountains. Afterwards, I immediately went back to my hotel and crashed for the night. The next day, still a bit wore out, I stopped for breakfast in Jackson and started the drive towards Utah.
