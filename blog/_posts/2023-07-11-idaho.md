I spent my second day in [Stanley, Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Idaho). It's a little touristy town of about a hundred people that has some nice restaurants, good views, and decent hikes. I got the chance to walk around the town, drive out to the [river above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_River_(Idaho)), which also sported some hot springs, and get out to hike by the [lake below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_Lake).

Overall, it was a very pretty (and expensive!) area and it was a nice quick stop on my way to Wyoming.
