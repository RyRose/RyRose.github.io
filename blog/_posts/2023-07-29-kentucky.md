My main stop in Kentucky was [Mammoth Cave National Park](https://www.nps.gov/maca) where they have the longest cave system in the world. Tickets typically sell out weeks in advance but they just so happened to have ticket for a tour ten minutes after my arrival.

I spent about 2 hours underground navigating its tunnels and definitely worth the $20 price of admission. Afterwards, I checked into my hotel in [Bowling Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green_massacre), ate some fast food, and relaxed for the night. The next day, I stopped at the [National Corvette Museum](https://www.corvettemuseum.org).

I'm not the biggest car guy so it was just okay. The cars were pretty and I liked the story about the [sinkhole](https://www.corvettemuseum.org/corvette-cave-in-exhibit) that destroyed part of the museum. Afterwards, I continued on my way to the next state. Onwards to Ohio!
