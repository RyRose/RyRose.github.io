So, I quit my job that I've working at for the last ~6 years and decided to make a blog. I won't go into detail here as to why I quit but please feel free to contact me directly if you're curious. For a cop-out answer, it felt like the right time to try something new. Like starting a blog lol. I do intend to go back into working in software but in the meantime, I'm starting this blog for two reasons: 

1. I have thoughts about things and I'd like to share them. These will likely be about tech/working in tech but mostly serves as my public stream of consciousness.
2. I'm about to do a big road trip and would like to maintain an online record of the trip with a [travel blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_literature#Travel_blogs).

I don't anticipate too much of #1 in the near future but I'm hoping to be posting about #2 regularly. And, well, that's about it for this update!
