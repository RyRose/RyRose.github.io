I spent most of my first day in Kansas driving for ~8 hours from Colorado Springs. I crashed that evening at a downtown hotel in Lawrence, Kansas and didn't do much aside from my laundry. Then, I ate my hotel breakfast in the morning and started walking around downtown.

My favorite stop in downtown was the [Watkins Museum](https://www.watkinsmuseum.org). It's free and it has a great set of exhibits that tell the history of the town. I stopped for lunch at a great Cajun restaurant, [Terrebonne](https://www.terrebonnelfk.com), and then left downtown for a nearby nature preserve.

I hiked around for a little bit and then headed back to my hotel for the night. The next day, I drove to northern Arkansas to visit with family for a few days and then started towards the next state. Onwards to Mississippi!
