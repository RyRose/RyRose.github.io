My first stop in North Dakota was the city of Fargo. That evening, I stopped for dinner at a delicious [German restaurant](https://wurstfargo.com) in downtown and wandered around where I snapped this photo.

The next day, I started driving towards my next state and stopped at [Theodore Roosevelt National Park](https://www.nps.gov/thro). Aside from Arches National Park, I think this was my favorite national park I visited on the road trip. I spent a few hours doing small hikes and driving through the south unit of the park where I snapped this photo.

I'd highly recommend this park especially since it never felt that busy. Afterwards, I continued driving to Montana. At this point, I was making a beeline back to Seattle since I was bit tired after driving for 30 days. So, after three more 6-hour days of driving, I finally made it back to Seattle, where I am now writing this post.

Looking back to the whole trip, I think I'd cut 1-2 weeks off it since it was a bit exhausting towards the end. Nonetheless, I appreciate the experiences I had and it definitely felt like a great way to spend time away from work. I don't know when I'll blog post again but now that I'm done with the road trip, it certainly won't be about that!
