My main stop in West Virginia was the city of Huntington. Aside from being conveniently located for my route, the motivation for Huntington in particular comes from a podcast I used to regularly listen to called [My Brother, My Brother and Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brother,_My_Brother_and_Me) where the hosts are originally from. After checking into my hotel in Huntington, I walked around downtown and snapped this picture at the waterfront park.

In addition to this park, I stumbled upon a **free** live concert going on in the town square that I spent an hour listening to. The next day, I checked out of my hotel and started driving towards my next state. Onwards to Kentucky!
