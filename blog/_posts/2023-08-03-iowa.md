My main stop in Iowa was the city of Cedar Rapids. To be honest, I didn't have any real ideas on what to do in Iowa aside from recreating a 7-year-old meme in Cedar Rapids.

I spent the night in a hotel, got decent ribs from a [local restaurant](https://emilshideaway.com), and drove the next morning to [`41°58'37.5"N 91°40'17.7"W`](https://reddit.com/r/cedarrapids/comments/eshh52/anyone_know_where_hillary_clintons_im_just/ffa69gn) to recreate the photo above. Afterwards, I continued my drive to Minnesota, where I met up with my best friend and we hung out for a few days hiking in northern Minnesota. After this brief deviation from the route, I continued my drive to the next state. Onwards to North Dakota!
