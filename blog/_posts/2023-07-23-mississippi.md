My first stop in Mississippi was Oxford, MS, where I spent the night. I checked into my hotel and headed towards to historical downtown square.

Aside from a prominent [confederate statue](https://www.wlox.com/2020/07/07/lafayette-co-supervisors-vote-unanimously-keep-confederate-statue-oxford-court-square), there was a lot of little shops and I stopped for dinner at a [great Creole restaurant](https://citygroceryonline.com/restaurants/boure). The next day, I headed off to see Elvis's birth place.

Conveniently along the route to Alabama, I stopped in Tupelo, MS where Elvis was born. There was a lot of mildly interesting signs to read and statues of Elvis. Unfortunately, the museum was closed when I tried to visit but I enjoyed the surrounding park. I didn't stay too long before I started heading off to the next state. Onwards to Alabama!
