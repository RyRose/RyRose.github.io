Arriving in the evening, I met up with a good friend and former coworker of mine in Provo, Utah. We had some ice cream and caught up for a little bit before heading to bed for the night. The next morning, we ate breakfast, went to a museum together, and then drove out a little ways to Sundance ski resort. Fun fact, it's related to the [Sundance Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival) in that they are owned and named by the [same person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford). We went up the ski lift to the top of the resort and grabbed a meal where I snapped this picture.

We then split for the rest of the trip where I relaxed from the heat for the rest of the day. I started for Colorado the next morning but stopped at Arches National Park before leaving the state. It was [hot](https://world-weather.info/forecast/usa/moab/17-july) but I got to see a few sights.

Overall, it was great to see my friend and I really enjoyed driving around Arches. Onwards to Colorado!
