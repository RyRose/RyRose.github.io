My main stop in Ohio was the Cincinnati Zoo.

After spending the night in a suburb nearby and dealing with frustrating rental car issues in the morning, I spent an hour at the zoo. It was small but dense with lots of nice exhibits. I also had the chance to pay my respects to [Harambe](https://www.dictionary.com/e/memes/harambe) at the gorilla exhibit so I'd say it's definitely worth it.

After leaving the zoo, I continued my drive to the next state. Onwards to Michigan!
