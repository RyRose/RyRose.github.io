My first and main stop in North Carolina was the [Biltmore House](https://www.biltmore.com).

*Biltmore House*

It was a house built for George Vanderbilt in the late 1800s and it was neat to take a tour of. The ticket felt a bit overpriced at [$85](https://www.biltmore.com/landing/ticket-options-for-summer) and it was difficult at times to stomach the amount of excess that was on display at the house. Nonetheless, I had a good time before heading off to check into my hotel for the night. The next day, I immediately started driving off to my next state. Onwards to West Virginia!
