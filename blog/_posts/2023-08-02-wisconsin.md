My main stop in Wisconsin was the city of Kenosha. In addition to being convenient along my route, I visited here upon recommendation from an old friend of mine. I spent the night in downtown and woke up the next morning to eat quite possibly my favorite meal so far this trip.

After breakfast, I headed towards the lakeside park where I visited the [Kenosha Public Museum](https://museums.kenosha.org) and snapped a photo outside of it of this lovely guy.

After this exploration, I continued the drive towards my next state. Onwards to Iowa!
