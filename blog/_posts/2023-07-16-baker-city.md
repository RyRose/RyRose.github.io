My first stop was a [motel](https://www.oregontrailmotelrestaurant.com) in Baker City, Oregon where I was a greeted with a double rainbow. It's a town of [10,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_City,_Oregon), about the same size as my [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Home,_Arkansas). It was essentially a place to rest before heading to Idaho but it was nice little town. There was a trail running through the town where I got a little exercise and saw some pretty views:

After ~5 hours of driving, it was a nice stop for the night and I had a good breakfast at the accompanying diner. Lastly, a smiling turtle I found because I can't not share it:

Onwards to Idaho!
