Upon arriving in Birmingham, I checked into my hotel and quickly met up with good friends of mine who just moved to Birmingham. We had a good time walking around the city where I snapped this picture.

We had dinner and drinks then chatted into the night until I went back to my hotel. I left the next morning to my next state. Onwards to Georgia!
